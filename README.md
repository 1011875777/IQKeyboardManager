You can use IQKeyboardManager to fix this issue with just one line of code:-

`[IQKeyBoardManager installKeyboardManager];`


Just drag and drop IQKeyboardManager class in your project. In your appDelegate write just one line of code. This will handle all UITextField/UITextView covering problem.


## Feature:-
 1) Support Device Orientation.
 
 2) Easy integration.

 3) UITextField Category for easily adding Next/Previous and Done button as Keyboard UIToolBar.

 4) Enable/Desable Keyboard Manager with Class methods.

 5) Enable/Desable Next/Previous with Category methods.

 6) Autohandle in Whole application without any extra work or code.
